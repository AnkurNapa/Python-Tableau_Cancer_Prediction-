# Python-Tableau_Cancer_Prediction-
We will build a recommender system that predicts the likelihood of a Pima woman having diabetes when inputting 7 parameters (age, BMI, pregnancies, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and skin thickness). The dataset is from a 1988 study by J.W. Smith, J.E. Everhart, W.C. Dickson, W.C. Knowler, and R.S. Johannes, accessible via the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245318/.
